# Examples on Google Colab
The following notebooks are meant to show entire training/testing workflows. (If you want to use just a loss or miner in your own code, you can do that too.) They generally go through the following steps:
- initialize models, optimizers, and transforms
- creates train/validation splits
- initialize a loss, miner, sampler, trainer, and tester
- train the model, record accuracy, and plot the embedding space

Before running the notebooks, make sure that the runtime type is set to "GPU", by going to the Runtime menu, and clicking on "Change runtime type".

Click "Open in playground" on the Colab header to interact with the notebook.
